# Hue Blog
- This is a blog template, just a quick project in React.js for some styling pratice, and to fill out my git.
- The blog's title, color scheme, and posts are pulled from .json files. I may go add an actual backend for posts later.
- The page is dynamically colored, currently it's set up to simulate a day/night cycle, changing color throughout the day (depending on device time).
- Special thanks to all the library contributors that made this possible.
