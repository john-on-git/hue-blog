- I'm planning to make a personal website with React, but I'm umming-and-erring over the visuals.
  So I figured I'd start with a nice simple project for practice. should be possible to get this done in a day or so.

- The blog will have a config value where you can set the hue. The rest of the blog will be dynamically
  colored to use that hue value (every color will be defined using a relative sat/lum).

- Config.json
    - blog name : string
    - hue value : number
    - tint the header image? : boolean
    
    - explanation of header image requirements (path & aspect ratio).
- Content.json

- Main Page
    - Header with branding.
    - Sidebar for socials.
    - A list of blog posts.
        - Content pulled from json.
        - Should automatically expand as you scroll down with no noticeable loading, appearing infinite.
